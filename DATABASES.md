# Database comparisons

### Serverless

The databases I am considering for this repo are all _serverless_. The idea behind this is that they are good for solo developers who cannot afford to spend a lot of money on a project that may or may not pan out, so using pay-for-what-you-need services (serverless, generally speaking) is a good solution for them.

1. Firestore
2. MongoDB Serverless
3. FaunaDB
4. Azure SQL Serverless
5. [Amazon S3](https://petewarden.com/2010/10/01/how-i-ended-up-using-s3-as-my-database/)
